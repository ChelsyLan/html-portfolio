<h1>My professional introduction</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Chelsy Lan, a Master's candidate in Computer Science at Northeastern University, with an impressive academic background including a dual degree in Law from Fudan University. My passion for software development is reflected in my diverse skill set, encompassing programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, and frameworks such as Spring Boot and React. My recent internship at Asiainfo-sec allowed me to significantly contribute to software testing and development, where I excelled in writing unit tests and designing test cases for security posture management products.

I've also demonstrated my capabilities in project-based environments, notably developing a full-stack web application for an NGO during the Hacking for Humanity Hackathon 2023, and creating various platforms including a video community platform and an e-commerce store. My projects have not only honed my technical skills but also showcased my ability to integrate various technologies for optimal solutions.

I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my blend of technical expertise and project experience to a Software Development Engineer Intern role, where I can contribute to innovative solutions and further develop my skills. Available from May to December 2024, I am open to opportunities in San Jose, CA, and am flexible regarding relocation.
